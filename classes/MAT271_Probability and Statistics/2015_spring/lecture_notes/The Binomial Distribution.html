<H1>The Binomial Distribution</H1>

In many cases, it is appropriate to summarize a group of independent observations by the 
number of observations in the group that represent one of two outcomes.  For example, the 
proportion of individuals in a random sample who support one of two political candidates fits
this description.  In this case, the <A HREF="sampinf.htm">statistic</A> 
<IMG SRC="phat.gif" WIDTH = 25 ALIGN="top"> is the <I>count</I> <I>X</I> of voters who support
the candidate divided by the total number of individuals in the group <I>n</I>.  This provides an 
estimate of the <A HREF="sampinf.htm">parameter</A> <I>p</I>, the proportion of 
individuals who support the candidate in the entire population.
<P>
The <I><B>binomial distribution</I></B> describes the behavior of a count variable <I>X</I> if
the following conditions apply:
<DL><DD><I><B>1:</B> The number of observations n is fixed.
<DD><B>2:</B> Each observation is independent.
<DD><B>3:</B> Each observation represents one of two outcomes ("success" or "failure").
<DD><B>4:</B> The probability of "success" p is the same for each outcome. </I></DL> 
<BR>If these conditions are met, then <I>X</I> has a binomial distribution with parameters 
<I>n</I> and <I>p</I>, abbreviated <I>B(n,p)</I>.  
<P>
<U>Example</U>
<P>
Suppose individuals with a certain gene have a 0.70 probability of eventually contracting 
a certain disease.  If 100 individuals with the gene participate in a lifetime study, then the 
distribution of the random variable describing the number of individuals who will contract the
disease is distributed <I>B(100,0.7)</I>.
<P>
<B><I>Note: The sampling distribution of a count variable is only well-described by the binomial
distribution is cases where the population size is significantly larger than the sample size.  
As a general rule, the binomial distribution should not be applied to observations from 
a <A HREF = "sample.htm#SRS">simple random sample (SRS)</A> unless the 
population size is at least 10 times larger than the sample size.</B></I>        
<P>
To find probabilities from a binomial distribution, one may either calculate them directly,
use a binomial table, or use a computer.  The number of sixes rolled by a single die in 20
rolls has a <I>B(20,1/6)</I> distribution.  The probability of rolling more than 2 sixes
in 20 rolls, <I>P(X&gt;2)</I>, is equal to 1 - <I>P(X<U>&lt;</U>2) = 1 - (P(X=0) + P(X=1) + 
P(X=2))</I>. Using the MINITAB command "cdf" with subcommand "binomial n=20 p=0.166667" gives the cumulative
distribution function as follows: 
<PRE>
Binomial with n = 20 and p = 0.166667

         x     P( X <= x)
         0        0.0261
         1        0.1304
         2        0.3287
         3        0.5665
         4        0.7687
         5        0.8982
         6        0.9629
         7        0.9887
         8        0.9972
         9        0.9994   	
</PRE>
The corresponding graphs for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function
for the <I>B(20,1/6)</I> distribution are shown below:<BR><IMG SRC="binpdf.gif">
<IMG SRC="bincdf.gif" HSPACE=40><P>
Since the probability of 2 or fewer sixes is equal to 0.3287, the probability of rolling more than
2 sixes = 1 - 0.3287 = 0.6713.      
<P>
<B>The probability that a random variable <I>X</I> with binomial distribution <I>B(n,p)</I> is
equal to the value <I>k</I>, where <I>k = 0, 1,....,n </I>, is given by </B>
<IMG SRC="binprob.gif" ALIGN="middle">, where <IMG SRC="bincoef.gif" ALIGN="middle">.
<BR>The latter expression is known as the <I><B>binomial coefficient</I></B>, stated as
"<I>n choose k</I>," or the number of possible ways to choose <I>k</I> "successes"
from <I>n</I> observations.  For example, the number of ways to achieve
2 heads in a set of four tosses is "4 choose 2", or 4!/2!2! = (4*3)/(2*1) = 
6.  The possibilities are {HHTT, HTHT, HTTH, TTHH, THHT, THTH}, where "H" represents
a head and "T" represents a tail.  The binomial coefficient multiplies the probability 
of <I>one</I> of these possibilities (which is (1/2)&sup2;(1/2)&sup2; = 1/16 for a fair coin) 
by the number of ways the outcome may be achieved, for a total probability of 6/16.   
  
<H3>Mean and Variance of the Binomial Distribution</H3>
The binomial distribution for a random variable <I>X</I> with parameters 
<I>n</I> and <I>p</I> represents the sum of
<I>n</I> independent variables <I>Z</I> which may assume the values 0 or 1.  
If the probability that each <I>Z</I> variable assumes the value 1 is equal 
to <I>p</I>, then the <A HREF="rvmnvar.htm#rvmean">mean</A>
of each variable is equal to <I>1*p + 0*(1-p) = p</I>, and the 
<A HREF="rvmnvar.htm#rvvar">variance</A> is equal to <I>p(1-p).</I>  By the 
addition properties for independent random variables, the mean and variance 
of the binomial distribution are equal to the sum of the means and variances 
of the <I>n</I> independent <I>Z</I> variables, so 
<IMG SRC = "binmv.gif" ALIGN="top">
<P>
These definitions are intuitively logical.  Imagine, for example, 8 flips
of a coin.  If the coin is fair, then <I>p</I> = 0.5.  One would expect the 
mean number of heads to be half the flips, or <I>np</I> = 8*0.5 = 4.  The
variance is equal to <I>np(1-p)</I> = 8*0.5*0.5 = 2.    
    
<A NAME="sampprop"></A><H3>Sample Proportions</H3>
If we know that the count <I>X</I> of "successes" in a group of <I>n</I> observations with
sucess probability <I>p</I> has a binomial distribution with mean <I>np</I> and variance
<I>np(1-p)</I>, then we are able to derive information about the distribution of the <I><B>
sample proportion</I></B><IMG SRC="phat.gif" WIDTH = 25 ALIGN="top">, the count of 
successes <I>X</I> divided by the number of observations <I>n</I>.  By the multiplicative 
properties of the mean, the mean of the distribution of <I>X/n</I> is equal to the mean of <I>X</I>
divided by <I>n</I>, or <I>np/n = p</I>.  This proves that the sample proportion 
<IMG SRC="phat.gif" WIDTH = 25 ALIGN="top"> is an <I>unbiased estimator</I> of the population 
proportion <I>p</I>.  The variance of <I>X/n</I> is equal to the variance
of <I>X</I> divided by <I>n&sup2;</I>, or <I>(np(1-p))/n&sup2; = (p(1-p))/n </I>.  This formula
indicates that as the size of the sample increases, the variance decreases.   
<P>
In the example of rolling a six-sided die 20 times, the probability <I>p</I> of rolling
a six on any roll is 1/6, and the count <I>X</I> of sixes has a <I>B(20, 1/6)</I> distribution. 
The mean of this distribution is 20/6 = 3.33, and the variance is 20*1/6*5/6 = 100/36 = 2.78. 
The mean of the <I>proportion</I> of sixes in the 20 rolls, <I>X/20</I>, is equal to 
<I>p</I> = 1/6 = 0.167, and the variance of the proportion is equal to (1/6*5/6)/20 = 0.007.

<H3>Normal Approximations for Counts and Proportions</H3>

<B>For large values of <I>n</I>, the distributions of the count <I>X</I> and the sample proportion 
<IMG SRC="phat.gif" WIDTH = 25 ALIGN="top"> are approximately <A HREF="normal.htm">normal</A>.
This result follows from the <A HREF = "sampmn.htm#clt">Central Limit Theorem</A>.
The mean and variance for the approximately normal distribution of <I>X</I> are <I>np</I> 
and <I>np(1-p)</I>, identical to the mean and variance of the binomial(<I>n,p</I>) distribution.
Similarly, the mean and variance for the approximately normal distribution of the sample
proportion are <I>p</I> and <I>(p(1-p)/n)</I>.</B>
<P>
<I>Note: Because the normal approximation is not accurate for small values of <I>n</I>, a good rule of 
thumb is to use the normal approximation only if <I>np<U>&gt;</U></I>10 and 
<I>np(1-p)<U>&gt;</U></I>10.</I>
<P>
For example, consider a population of voters in a given state.  The true proportion of voters who 
favor candidate A is equal to 0.40.  Given a sample of 200 voters, what is the probability that
more than half of the voters support candidate A?  
<P>
The count <I>X</I> of voters in the sample of 200 who support candidate A is distributed
<I>B(200,0.4)</I>.  The mean of the distribution is equal to 200*0.4 = 80, and the variance is equal
to 200*0.4*0.6 = 48.  The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, 6.93.  The 
probability that more than half of the voters in the sample support candidate A is equal to
the probability that <I>X</I> is greater than 100, which is equal to 1- <I>P(X<U>&lt;</U></I> 100).
<P>
To use the normal approximation to calculate this probability, we should first acknowledge that
the normal distribution is <I>continuous</I> and apply the <I><B>continuity correction</B></I>.
This means that the probability for a single discrete value, such as 100, is extended to the 
probability of the <I>interval</I> (99.5,100.5).  Because we are interested in the probability
that <I>X</I> is less than or equal to 100, the normal approximation applies to the upper limit
of the interval, 100.5.  If we were interested in the probability that <I>X</I> is strictly less
than 100, then we would apply the normal approximation to the lower end of the interval, 99.5.
<P>
So, applying the continuity correction and standardizing the variable <I>X</I> gives the following:
<BR>1 - <I>P(X<U>&lt;</U></I> 100) 
<BR>= 1 - <I>P(X<U>&lt;</U></I> 100.5) 
<BR>= 1 - <I>P(Z<U>&lt;</U></I> (100.5 - 80)/6.93) 
<BR>= 1 - <I>P(Z<U>&lt;</U></I> 20.5/6.93)
<BR>= 1 - <I>P(Z<U>&lt;</U></I> 2.96) = 1 - (0.9985) = 0.0015.  Since the value 100 is nearly three
standard deviations away from the mean 80, the probability of observing a count this high is 
extremely small.
